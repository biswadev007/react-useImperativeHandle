The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Use of `useImperativeHandle` hook

As React says always to lift up the state. But sometimes for larger application it won't possible to lift the state up. In that scenario if we need to access or call any function of child component to parent component then we need to use this hook.
It took two parameter one `ref` and callback function.
